      <description>I just give up using Lightroom.
Because I had to reinstall my system after Christmas, so I choose to try and install Manjaro along with the OEM Windows10. Taking this opportunity, I spent some time transfered all my photo collections from Lightroom 6 to Darktable.
The darktable used Lensfun library to perform lens correction. Lensfun have collected a lot of lens and camera data. By now (2020-02-28) there&#39;re 1057 lenses in the database, and all the popular cameras are covered.</description>

      <description>The Lightroom 6 was killed by Adobe in 2017 and will never get updates any more. For people (like me) who don&#39;t want to subscribe to Adobe&#39;s plans and are sticking with LR6, I found a way to add new lens profiles to LR6.</description>

      <description>Two week ago, we went to the Point Pelee National Park to watch the migrating birds (mainly warblers). It&#39;s a wonderful experience. We saw a lot of birds that we have never seen before in local area.</description>

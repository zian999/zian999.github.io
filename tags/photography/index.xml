      <description>TLDR: After your adobe lightroom subscription ends, you still have access to all your local photos, and use all the modules except for the Develop and Map modules. This means you can still import new photos and manage all your photos with Lightroom&amp;rsquo;s tagging, keyword, filter and even quick develop functions, which makes it possible to use LrC as a standalone DAM (digital asset management) software and leave complex editing tasks to other dedicated softwares like GIMP and Capture NX-D.</description>

      <description>I just give up using Lightroom.
Because I had to reinstall my system after Christmas, so I choose to try and install Manjaro along with the OEM Windows10. Taking this opportunity, I spent some time transfered all my photo collections from Lightroom 6 to Darktable.
The darktable used Lensfun library to perform lens correction. Lensfun have collected a lot of lens and camera data. By now (2020-02-28) there&amp;rsquo;re 1057 lenses in the database, and all the popular cameras are covered.</description>

      <description>The Lightroom 6 was killed by Adobe in 2017 and will never get updates any more. For people (like me) who don&amp;rsquo;t want to subscribe to Adobe&amp;rsquo;s plans and are sticking with LR6, I found a way to add new lens profiles to LR6.</description>

      <description>Two week ago, we went to the Point Pelee National Park to watch the migrating birds (mainly warblers). It&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful experience. We saw a lot of birds that we have never seen before in local area.</description>
